#### Where to get help
Well help is required and there's no shame in asking for it:

 There are a few places where you can get help. If you're using linux, you can access the man pages for good technical documentation. Erlang has a lists module (which we'll soon see): to get the documentation on lists, just type in `$ erl -man lists`.

On Windows, the installation should include HTML documentation. You can download it at any time from the [official erlang site](http://erlang.org/doc/ "Official Erlang HTML documentation"), or consult one of the [cleaner alternative sites](http://erldocs.com/ "Unofficial Erlang HTML documentation").

Good coding practices can be found [here](http://www.erlang.se/doc/programming_rules.shtml) once you feel you need to get everything clean. The code in this book will attempt to follow these guidelines, too.

Now, there are times where just getting the technical details isn't enough. When that happens, I tend to turn to two main sources: the official [mailing list](http://www.erlang.org/static/doc/mailinglist.html) (you should follow it just to learn a bunch) and the [#erlang](irc://irc.freenode.net/erlang) channel on [irc.freenode.net](http://freenode.net/).

Oh and if you're the type of person to go for cookbooks and pre-made recipes, [trapexit](http://trapexit.org/ "trapexit, an Erlang community site") is the place you're looking for. They also mirror the mailing lists as a forum and a general wiki, which can always be helpful.
