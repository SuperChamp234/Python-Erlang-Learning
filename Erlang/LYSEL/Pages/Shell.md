I have no idea how the shell works ngl.

###### Here are some of the rules that the shell follows(or perhaps the language)

- Each Statement must end with a period `.`
- If you're writing continued statements, you can abort the sequence using `^G` and enter.
- For unresponsive shells, we can
	- Press `abort with ^G`
	- press `i` and `c` in the User switch command menu
	- That should bring us back to the normal command prompt.

I'll update this note as I play along with the shell.
